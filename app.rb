    I would ask myself 'is this or will this be meaningful to me?',
    and if the answer was 'no', I wouldn't do it. It was this book that influenced me to
    consciously live as meaningful a life as possible,
    to place a great value on the journey and not just the destination,
    while knowing that 'meaningful' doesn't always mean 'enjoyable'. 'Meaningful' should be equated with 'fulfilling'.

    ut this book was something else. Beautifully written and easy to read,
    this book just made me want to know more and more about how the author
    thinks the world evolved to what it is today.
    Revolution by revolution, religion by religion, conception by conception,
    things were simplified and yet still maintained valid points - and it was never boring.

    of cities and constraints of modern society and castrating.
    Life as it should savor with nothing and everything around us
    and beyond us when we want others through profit prohibit enjoyment.
    Unlike many philosophers understandable for a pretentious intellectual minority,
    Thoreau speaks true to all of the original life that we live simply and 'naturally poetic.'
    An indispensable bible!

    message = "Kundera observes the stuff that goes on internally amongst the characters;
    he intellectualizes it, and tells you about it. He‚Äôs quite philosophical,
    and you feel like the narrator is talking to you, offering very insightful
    observations about the characters and life in general. This is one reason why
    reading is often more valuable than watching TV or a movie: when reading a
    good book you get direct psychological explanations, and you get to go inside the heads of characters.
    üêª Now...type 'more' to learn see more my thoughts on this book, another book title or just say goodbye to me."
  elsif body == "more"
    message = "Taken as a whole, I found this novel to be profound, but in unusual ways.
    It‚Äôs not a direct novel, but rather one that represents, and lets one feel,
    disconnections and various glimpses of perceptions. And it wasn‚Äôt a smooth novel, either.
    It even felt choppy on occasion. But the chapters are short, which fits its feel,
    and also gives you time to think about the penetrating thoughts that Kundera puts across.
    Kundera strikes me as a craftsman of sorts. He switches timelines deftly and effectively ‚Äì
    even when I thought he was crazy to do so; when I thought he gave up the climax of the novel
      towards its middle, he proved me dead wrong. He proved to me that he knew exactly what he was
      doing because he‚Äôs a master of the craft. This novel is not full of sweeping, pounding
      paragraphs of poignant, soul-hitting, philosophical depth, but rather offers up constant
      glimpses; nuggets of insightful observations on almost every page, that when added up together,
      reveal an impressive, heartfelt, and real work.
      üêª Type another book title or just say goodbye to me."
    elsif body == "the wisdom of life"
      message = "Beginning with the assumption that one's life will be essentially painful and miserable,
      Schopenhauer proceeds to offer thoughts about how we can eke out a bit of pleasure for ourselves
      during our brief time on this earth. Underlying much of his advice is the notion one should
      proceed cautiously, with restraint, curbing one's desires to avoid falling into situations,
      social or consumptive that will only make us more miserable. Don't desire too much, he implies,
      let happiness rest on small simple elements.
      Much of Schopenhauer's advice resonates with our modern sensibilities.
      Maintaining physical and mental health through exercise of body and mine is, he says, essential to happiness.
      Much of the advice offered is familiar to us but the thoroughness of his insights
      into how one best live one's life is definitely worth reading and rereading.
